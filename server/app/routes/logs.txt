Timeout Error Log:

Let's break down the log and identify the issue:

State: The state of the task is TERMINATED, which indicates that the task has stopped.

Termination Details: The termination_details section provides more information about the failure.

Code: The error code is TIMEOUT_ERROR, which suggests that the task took too long to execute.

Type: The error type is SERVER_ERROR, which indicates that the issue is related to server-side processing.

Message: The error message is quite informative:

Task new failed due to a timeout. The execution took longer than the allowed time limit, which resulted in the task being forcibly terminated.

From this message, we can infer the following:

The task was terminated because it exceeded the maximum allowed execution time.
This could be due to long-running queries, inefficient operations, or resource constraints.
To resolve the issue, you may want to:

Optimize the task or query to reduce execution time.
Increase the timeout limit if possible.
Review resource allocation to ensure sufficient capacity for the task.
By addressing these factors, you should be able to mitigate timeout errors and improve task execution times.


Authentication Error Log:

Let's break down the log and identify the issue:

State: The state of the task is TERMINATED, which indicates that the task has stopped.

Termination Details: The termination_details section provides more information about the failure.

Code: The error code is AUTHENTICATION_FAILED, which suggests that the authentication credentials were incorrect.

Type: The error type is CLIENT_ERROR, which indicates that the problem is likely related to incorrect credentials or configuration on the client-side.

Message: The error message is quite informative:

Task new failed due to authentication failure. The provided credentials were invalid or expired, preventing access to the required resources.

From this message, we can infer the following:

The task failed because it could not authenticate with the required services or resources.
This could be due to expired tokens, incorrect API keys, or misconfigured authentication settings.
To resolve the issue, you may want to:

Verify and update the authentication credentials.
Check the configuration settings for any errors.
Ensure that tokens or keys are valid and have not expired.
By addressing these factors, you should be able to resolve authentication issues and ensure smooth access to resources.

Resource Not Found Error Log:

Let's break down the log and identify the issue:

State: The state of the task is TERMINATED, which indicates that the task has stopped.

Termination Details: The termination_details section provides more information about the failure.

Code: The error code is RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND, which suggests that a required resource was not found.

Type: The error type is SERVER_ERROR, which indicates that the issue is related to missing or misconfigured resources on the server-side.

Message: The error message is quite informative:

Task new failed because the requested resource was not found. This could be due to a deleted, moved, or misnamed resource.

From this message, we can infer the following:

The task could not locate the required resource, leading to failure.
This could be due to incorrect resource identifiers, resource deletion, or misconfiguration.
To resolve the issue, you may want to:

Verify that the resource exists and is correctly identified.
Check if the resource was moved or deleted.
